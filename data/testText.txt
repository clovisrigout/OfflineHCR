hello my name is clovis
the goal of this algorithm is to recognize your handwriting
while many algorithms do this quite well online this algorithm works offline
we disregard the issue of segmentation and thus assume words taken as inputs are already segmented in characters

we trained a convolutional neural network with the stanford OCR dataset
we the strongly bias this network by training it with distorted variations of an alphabet of twenty siz characters
the input is a word split up into characters
the first step of the algorithm consists in feeding the sequence of characters to a convolutional neural network one character at a time
the output of the neural network is then fed into a hidden markov
the hidden markov model is used to consider the probabilistic distribution of sequences of characters in words
as each character in a word in processed the most probably sequence of characters in outputed by the hmm
