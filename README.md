ML Project for Offline Targeted Handwriting Recognition:

COMP 652 Final Project
McGill University

Machine Learning Architecture built to recognize a specific handwriting style, achieving over 90% accuracy.

To train and test model:
	- get data : python src/data.py
	- train model : python src/model.py
	=> model will be saved in models/

Dependencies needed :
	- mlpython : hg clone https://bitbucket.org/HugoLarochelle/mlpython (http://www.dmi.usherb.ca/~larocheh/mlpython/install.html)
	- tensorflow, numpy, scikit, nltk
